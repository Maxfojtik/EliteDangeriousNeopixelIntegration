# EliteDangeriousNeopixelIntegration
Uses a combination of the Journal file and the Status.json file to determine what to display on the LEDs.
There are two projects within this repo, the Arduino project and the Java project, you will have to sort them out individually.

| Known Microcontrollers | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| Arduino Nano | Works |
| Teensy LC | Works on pin 17 |
| Arduino Uno | No reason it shouldnt |
